#  Presenting the correctness of the implementation:
The output of the implementaion was correct because they match the expected output from the algorithm
The output:
==============================
Edge : Weight

------------
1---6 : 10
6---5 : 25
5---4 : 22
4---3 : 12
3---2 : 16
2---7 : 14
The cost of completed minimum spanning tree is 99
============================


#The inputed graph was:
